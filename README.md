These are 3 of my finished projets from past year. Cars project was fully made by me, except for the API, which was provided to us by school, other two tasks were made by me and a another student. My contributions for the projets basicly were: For the forum task, most of the front-end, most of the database, and for example the search functionality. For the stations task, the basic structure of the app and the algo, bug fixing in the final version, and all of the testing functionality.
